# Google API Facade for Scala.js

Currently, only OAuth support is being focused on, but ultimately this will contain several Google API facades.

## Library Dependencies

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.outr" %%% "googleapi-scala-js" % "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

For now, take a look at the [Test class](https://github.com/outr/googleapi.scala.js/blob/master/src/main/scala/test/Test.scala)

## Help Wanted

This facade is born of need, and lacks completeness in many areas. However, PRs are extremely welcome to fill in the
gaps.
